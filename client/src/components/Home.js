                I opened Peace of Mind Playschool in 2018 to provide families
                with a high quality, structured childcare and preschool program.
                My goal is to provide a developmentally appropriate program that
                respects each child as an individual in a loving environment
                that is fun, educational and safe. I will provide curriculum and
                opportunities for growth that are developmentally appropriate,
                help children feel confident and self-reliant, and develop a
                sense of self-worth and foster good self-esteem. I will always
                take time to listen to their thoughts, feelings and ideas. My
                program reflects the understanding that play is essential to
                childrenâ€™s health and well-being and foundational to their
                learning. I promise to nurture your child, provide protection,
                encouragement, security and stimulation. Families are assured
                that non- discrimination and respect for each child and their
                family and culture is always maintained in a professional
                manner.
