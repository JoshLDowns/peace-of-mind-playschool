              <span className="strong-text">PHILOSOPHY:</span> I opened Peace of
              Mind Playschool in 2018 to provide families with high quality,
              affordable child care with the belief that children must be
              respected, and that children love to learn. I believe in providing
              children with an environment where they have space to explore and
              create, collaborate with peers and learn through nature. Nature
              offers infinite ways to support a child’s cognitive, physical, and
              emotional development, and interacting with natural environments
              and materials allows children to learn by doing, and experiment
              with ideas. When children are engaged in learning about science
              and nature, they are also learning strategies for active
              exploration, thinking and reasoning, and developing working
              theories for making sense of the natural, social, physical and
              material worlds around them. By promoting learning through nature,
              I hope to foster the development of nurturing, peaceful, and
              caring citizens. My program reflects the understanding that play
              and outdoor exploration is essential to children’s health and
              well-being, and foundational to their learning. I promise to
              nurture your child, provide a safe and loving environment, and
              give them the freedom to explore and create.

              change depending on each child’s individual needs. Generally,
              within a few weeks we fall into a predictable schedule. The ideal
              goal is to include infants in as much of the curriculum as
              possible and have one nap fall within the same nap time as the

              time of year, and a few changes of clothes. During summer months
              we may take walks in the woods or down the road. We will have
              water play. A bathing suit that can stay at daycare is highly
              recommended. In the winter we will go outside when the weather is
              not severe and it’s not too windy. Generally, we go outside twice
              each day in warmer months, and once each day in the winter months.

              who do not sleep may play quietly or read. If a pick-up is needed

              at Peace of Mind Playschool are reinforced for being responsible
              for their own behavior. We stress independence in solving problems
              and offer guidance in finding solutions. We encourage self-control
              and cooperation through positive discipline such as redirection,
              distraction and praise. In cases of continual disruption, the
              child may be removed from the situation for a short period of time
              to learn that acceptable behavior is encouraged. I am free at any
              time, to discuss any concerns you may have in this area.
